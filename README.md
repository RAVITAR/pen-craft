# ✍️ Pen Craft

**Pen Craft** is a full-stack project built as part of my university coursework. It brings together a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend to create a clean, user-friendly space for structured content creation. It’s organized, secure, and easy to navigate — both in the UI and under the hood.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- 🎨 A React-based frontend with modular, reusable components  
- ⚙️ A Node.js backend using Express, neatly split into routes, controllers, and models  
- 📁 Clear folder structure that keeps things easy to maintain  
- 🔐 Environment variables handled securely with `.env` and `.gitignore`  
- 🔒 Route protection and basic auth logic already in place  
- 🖼️ Screenshots and folder previews included so you can get a feel for the setup
